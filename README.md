This is a one stop solution to overcome the mental stress in the modern lifestyle with remote working culture and inculcate the fitness habit along with assessing up the individual's condition.

Firstly I  have a chrome extension with features of Tracker, Reminders, Exercises and Meditation. Tracker includes tracking your daily progress with tasks, In reminders, we get Water, Blink, Posture & Stress. Then comes Exercises and Meditation, where you will be guided with things to follow and directed into Homepage of Web App

Finally, the ML model has been built using various algorithms to assess the person's mental health condition and using extracted .wav model, it has been deployed into Streamlit application. 

It's a customized application which I has exposed in form of single project in GitHub repository by creating separate branches for showcasing in various sectors.
